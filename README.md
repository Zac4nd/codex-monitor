# Codex Monitor

Small, always-on-top PyQt6 widget for monitoring local Codex CLI executions on Linux.

- Green when no monitored executions are active; red otherwise.
- Expand with ▾ to inspect PID, project, elapsed time and command.
- Right-click any execution to ignore it without terminating it.
- Restore exclusions with the button in expanded view.
- Refreshes every 1.5 seconds; persistent Codex app servers are excluded.

## Requirements

Linux with `/proc`, Python 3, PyQt6 (`sudo apt install python3-pyqt6` on Debian).

## Usage

Run `./run.sh` or `python3 monitor.py`; use `python3 monitor.py --check` for a process scan.

Ignored process identities are stored in `~/.local/share/codex-monitor/ignored.json` and expire after their processes finish.

## Limitations

Process-based detection cannot determine actual task progress or success. Codex app-server sessions are not counted.
